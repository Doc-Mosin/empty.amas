How to use the mission?
Download. Rename empty.amas-main folder to empty.amas and copy it to your mpmission folder in your DayZ server.
After unpacking you have to unpack the areaflags.rar. At over 40Mb, it's too big for Github. Then you can delete the areaflags.rar directory

I only host the vanilla mission on my github account for my Amas server.

All rights to the map and mission are owned by AlexTrust ( https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999988745 ), who offers the Amas map for free in the DayZ workshop.
